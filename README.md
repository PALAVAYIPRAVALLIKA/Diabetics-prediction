# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
A machine learning-based project aimed at early diabetes detection using diagnostic measurements. Built using various classification algorithms and data visualization techniques for predictive modeling.
## Project Overview
Early diagnosis of diabetes significantly improves treatment outcomes. This project uses machine learning to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of diabetes using supervised learning algorithms.
## Methodology 
Early diagnosis of diabetes is crucial to prevent serious health complications. This project utilized a dataset containing 768 patient records with 8 diagnostic features alongside a target outcome indicating diabetes presence. 
Three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest—were trained and evaluated. Among these, the Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance.
Achieving an accuracy of 91% and an impressive ROC-AUC score of 95.99%, indicating its strong ability to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
## Model Performance
| Model               | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Logistic Regression | 89%      | 95.04%  |
| SVM                 | 91%      | 95.16%  |
| Random Forest       | 91%      | 95.99%  |
